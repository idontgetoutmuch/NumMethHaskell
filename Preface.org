Many users of numerical methods, including physicists, financial
engineers and machine learning practitioners, have dipped their toes
in the functional waters only to find, to mix metaphors, that it is
not to their taste. In the functional community, with some notable
exceptions, numerical computations are not given a high profile and
few worked examples are available with the result that, when a user of
numerical methods implements something, it is often done using lists,
almost guaranteeing poor performance and resultant distaste.

Functional programmers on the other hand are also reluctant to dip
their toes in the numerical methods waters, even though there are many
features of Haskell which make it an excellent vehicle for such
adventures; individuals who have mastered category theory should have
no fear of other fields of mathematics! For example, implementing
neural networks is significantly easier using automatic
differentiation in Haskell than using the traditional method of
backpropagation, solving partial differential equations using
computational stencils can be done just by writing down the stencil in
a very transparent way and power series approximations such as
Legendre polynomials are straightforward using Haskell's lazy
evaluation.

This book is intended to show that one can have one's cake and eat it
in the sense that one can obtain the all benefits of functional
programming applied to numerical problems without sacrificing much in
the way of performance. Hopefully, this will appeal to anyone who
falls into either of the above categories. Through an extended series
of worked examples, it shows that it is possible to have both a
representation in code of a problem that is close to the way one would
express it mathematically without sacrificing performance. In
particular, some of the examples can be made to run on multiple
processors in parallel with little or no change. In each of the
examples, an exposition is given of the theory behind it; this is
certainly not a pure numerical methods cookbook. In addition, each
example is coded in Haskell, the code is explained, including the main
Haskell numerical libraries, and the results of the output are
presented together with performance measurements.

There are many ways in which this book could be organised: by Haskell
library, by numerical technique or by discipline to which the
techniques and libraries can be applied. In the end, we opted to
create three sections: finite difference methods, Monte Carlo methods
and other methods. Within these sections, we intermingle specific
methods and their theory with applications of Haskell libraries to
specific examples which motivate the methods. Hopefully the reader
will find (at least some of) the applications as fascinating and as
practical as we have and leave with an appreciation of how a
particular technique and Haskell library can be applied to a problem
they have at hand.

A word is in order on what constitues a functional
language. Currently, many languages claim they are functional by which
they mean functions are first class. A more demanding definition would
include static typing and no mutability or side effect which then
allow reasoning about programs in a straightforward way. For us that
means Haskell.

After 25 years of developement, it might be supposed that Haskell is a
mature language. In many senses it is, but the language, the principal
compiler ghc and its libraries continue to develop at a rapid
rate. Even a few years ago, one could not have hoped to write a book
such as this and many pundits maintained that functional programming
and Haskell in particular would never be used for real
applications. There is still a long way to go but it seems, for now at
any rate, the future is functional. Given this rapid rate of progress,
it is to be hoped that even better techniques for numerical methods in
Haskell will appear in the near future.
